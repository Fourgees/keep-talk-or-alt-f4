A simple python script that lets you choose your microphone (I used a virtual audio cable that is tied into my alerts on twitch from obs and my main mic) and then if the audio falls under the threshold (you may need to adjust this to your needs) it alt+f4 your application.

I used this for a phasmophobia challenge.
